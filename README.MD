## Description
This addon allows you to easily mark your tank using the single slash command **/marktank**. It makes tracking the tank's location simpler, especially in scenarios with numerous enemies.  
Gone are the days of sifting through group frames to find the tank and deciding on a mark. Now, just create a macro with this command. You can even select your preferred mark.  
If no tank is present in the group, the addon will attempt to mark the group/raid leader.
Remember, to set marks in a raid, appropriate permissions are required.

## Slash Commands
- **/marktank** — Sets the default mark: the blue square
- **/marktank {mark}** — Choose a specific mark, e.g., /marktank purple or /marktank cross. Both color and shape options are allowed: star/yellow, circle/orange, diamond/purple, triangle/green, moon, square/blue, cross/red, and skull/white.
- **/marktank help** — Displays detailed information about the addon and these commands
